# Learning1 C#
This is the first repository of me learning the basics of C#.
Im currently learning from a (in my oppinion) very good youtube tutorial series. This series of learning C# will have 7 repositories since there are only 7 Episodes. 
In every new repository of mine there will be the youtube link of the current used repository.
